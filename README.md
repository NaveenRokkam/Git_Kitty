# Branch

#### Show a list of all branches
`git branch`


### Create a new local branch from existing Branch
```
git branch <BName>
```

### Update local work directory files to branch <BName>
```
git checkout <BName>
```

### Fetching a new branch <bNewRemote> from Remote (github) to local repository
```
git fetch & git checkout <bNewRemote>
```

### Submit a Branch to Remote
1. Checkout the branch to submit to remote `git checkout <BName>`
2. Push the changes the Remote `git push origin <BName>`

***
# Rebase

## Play branch <BName> on master
The user is currently making changes in local branch BName and wants to merge to Master

1. Play the changes of branch on Master `git rebase master`
2. Want to add more files `git add <FileName>`
3. Continue rebase i.e. play the new files on master `git rebase -continue`
4. git checkout master
```
Fast forward the master `git merge <BName>``
```



***
# Version of Commit
#### Show Commit history for Branch <BName>:
`git log <BName>`
#### Show the Head and Master in commit History for branch <BName>:
`git log <BName> -- decorate`

```
git worktree list
```

# You forked a source and source has moved ahead. How to make your Fork up to date with Source and then apply your local <br> changes to Source.

#### Add a new remote : `Upstream` for the Source git repo
1. ``` git remote add Upstream https://github.com/NaveenRokkam/Git_Kitty.git ( Originial source which was used to fork)
```
2. ``` git remote -v
```

#### Fetch the `Upstream` changes into local master
```git pull upstream master
```

#### Push changes from local master to Originial
``` git push origin master
```
Now the upstream repository changes are available in origin/master and local master branches

Update your local branch <br> with local master using [rebase](#id123)


# When local branch is not in sync with local master (#id123)
``` git checkout <br>
    git rebase master
```
Rebase: The current branch <br> would be brought to the same commit as Master and the delta changes in <br> would be played on top of the master Commit.

Now there is a new commit and the master is behind.
``` git checkout master
    git merge <br>
```
This will fast forward master to the newest commit on <br>
